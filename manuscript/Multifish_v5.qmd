## Abstract

Molecular data from environmental samples can reflect the abundance of species' DNA, an index immediately relevant to natural resources management at a continental scale. These data commonly derive from qPCR or ddPCR assays -- which focus on a single species -- or metabarcoding assays from more general PCR primers that amplify many species simultaneously. Multispecies analyses make efficient use of field samples and laboratory time, and speak to inherently multispecies questions of management and ecological research. However, unlike single-species techniques, metabarcoding by itself can reflect only the proportions of target-species DNA present, not their absolute quantities. Here, we combine qPCR and metabarcoding data derived from the same samples to map quantities of many fish species along the US Pacific coast in three dimensions, demonstrating a technique of practical importance for both management and ecology. We derive spatially explicit estimates of eDNA abundance for 13 common species of commercial and management importance and point the way to quantitative surveys of wild species using molecules alone. We found that species distribution maps derived from eDNA effectively capture species niches and spatial distributions. Notably, our analyses identified biodiversity hotspots that align with previously documented regions of ecological significance, such as the Columbia River plume and the Heceta Bank.

Environmental DNA (eDNA, residual genetic material sampled from water, soil, or air) is an increasingly common tool for non-invasively sampling marine and aquatic ecological communities, valuable for estimating species occurrence [@veilleux2021], biodiversity [i.e., Richness, @muenzel2024], and genetic structure [@andres2023a]. However, eDNA has not been widely used for quantitative abundance estimation, upon which many practical management and conservation applications rely (but see @shelton2022, @guri2024a, and @stoeckle2024). While the use of eDNA for quantification is supported both conceptually -- where there is more of a species, more cells are shed in the environment, and thus there is more DNA -- and empirically (e.g. there are strong linkages between single-species eDNA measures of in aquaria [@jo2019b; @ledger2024], rivers and streams [@pont2024], estuaries and nearshore habitats [@dibattista2022; @baetscher2024], and coastal oceans [@maes2023; @shelton2019], quantitative uses of eDNA observations have significantly lagged behind their use in occurrence and biodiversity applications. 

Quantitative estimates of DNA are more common with species-specific assays (e.g. qPCR and ddPCR) because these approaches directly measure DNA concentration. In contrast, multispecies analysis (metabarcoding) reflects information on many species of interest simultaneously, but at the costs of producing compositional estimates of proportional abundance [@gloor2017a; @mclaren2019] that may require statistical correction for species-specific biases due to PCR amplification [@shelton2023]. Consequently, metabarcoding data alone cannot yield information about the abundances of DNA from environmental samples [e.g. @guri2024a].

While trawling and other traditional sampling methods have been the fundamental tools for directly measuring fish abundance and biomass, they are often impractical for species inhabiting inaccessible habitats, occurring at low densities, or being fragile and easily injured during capture. By contrast, eDNA sampling captures information on a broader range of taxa, including those that are difficult or impossible to study with traditional gear. As such, eDNA can meaningfully complement traditional stock assessment methods for commercially important species while at the same time revealing the abundance and distribution of elusive or understudied species.

Here, we develop quantitative estimates for a diverse group of fish species spanning different depth niches across 10 degrees of latitude along the US west coast entirely from eDNA. We integrate single- and multi-species techniques to create three-dimensional distribution maps, leveraging models established in previous studies [@shelton2022, @guri2024a, @shelton2023, @allan2023]. By calibrating metabarcoding data -- correcting raw species observations to their initial proportions using a mock community [@shelton2023] -- and using the absolute eDNA quantity of a reference species (here Pacific Hake (*Merluccius productus*)), we expand initial estimated proportions into absolute estimates of the abundance of each species' eDNA [@guri2024a]. We subsequently smooth the estimated eDNA quantities to generate species distribution maps [@liu2023]. We present results for 13 fish species to illustrate the approach, but note that it immediately generalizes to any ecological community of interest.

The eDNA-derived estimates we provide here speak directly to the requirements of natural-resources management at large scales. For example, indices of abundance have a central role in determining stock status for fisheries applications (i.e. stock assessments in the U.S. under the Magnunson-Stevens Act) as well as informing conservation status (e.g., under the U.S. Endangered Species Act). Thus eDNA-derived abundance indices can fill a variety of existing legal requirements for management. While these indices are still in their infancy and will require additional technical developments to ensure their proper usage, they are conceptually and practically little different from abundance estimates derived from more traditional ocean survey method (i.e. net-based or acoustic surveys). Indeed, eDNA methods may provide some notable improvements because single- and multi-species eDNA approaches avoid tradeoffs involved with physically capturing many species simultaneously using a single net. Molecular surveys capture many species with the same "gear" using methods that are easily replicated in space and time. As agencies begin to implement the new National Aquatic eDNA Strategy [@kelly2024] -- the first goal of which is to fold eDNA data into federal decisionmaking -- this and other large-scale examples point the way to maximizing the benefit of this information-rich datastream for natural-resources management at a continental scale.


# Results

We find spatial patterns of DNA concentrations reflect the distributions of commercially important coastal-pelagic fish species with remarkable fidelity, in three dimensions and across ten degrees of latitude (Fig. \ref{Fig1}: Northern Anchovy, Pacific Sardine; Supplement Pacific Herring and Jack Mackerel). For other high-biomass species otherwise lacking well-described distributions, we provide the first species distribution models (Fig. \ref{Fig1}, other species). We find that the estimated eDNA concentrations are correlated among species with similar traits and habitat preferences (Fig. \ref{Fig2}). Emergent patterns of species richness and estimated eDNA aggregation correspond with known ecological drivers [NOTE: Gled, need to insert measure of primary productivity, or similar], evidence that eDNA traces can reliably capture ecologically meaningful patterns (Fig. /ref{Fig3}). Particularly for forage fish species -- which are critical high-biomass links in marine food webs, but difficult to survey with traditional methods [@Pikitch2012LittleFB] -- molecular methods offer a tractable and quantitative index of abundance over large spatial scales.

Below we highlight results for six species representing different depth habitats; all species shown in the supplemental material.

## Species distribution maps

![Estimated species eDNA concentration (A) across 0, 50, 150, 300, and 500m depth samples and known depth distribution of those species from literature (B)\label{Fig1}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMARINeDNA/QM-qPCR-joint/refs/heads/main/plots/1.%20Figure_1.jpg)

### **Surface**

Northern anchovy (*Engraulis mordax*) inhabits epipelagic waters between Baja California and British Columbia, with larvae and juveniles typically occurring at somewhat shallower depths than the adults [@litz2008; @parnel2008]. The species has a major spawning peak in July (our sampling period), centered on the nutrient-rich water near the Columbia River plume [@litz2008]. Our eDNA estimates mirrored these expected patterns, revealing high concentrations in surface waters at northern latitudes (Columbia River outflow at latitude 46.2°N; Fig. \ref{Fig1}), particularly near the Columbia River outflow. Pacific sardine (*Sardinops sagax*) favors slightly warmer temperatures (SST 18–24°C vs. 10–14°C for the anchovy) and typically inhabits slightly greater depths [@nevarez-martinez2001]. Our estimated eDNA patterns tracked these known differences with sardine eDNA peaking at 41°N (range 40°–45°), while anchovy eDNA peaking at 43.5°N (range 42°–48°; Fig. \ref{Fig4}) indicating how eDNA can capture subtle yet meaningful differences in habitat preferences.

### **Mid-water**

Widow rockfish (*Sebastes entomelas*) are common between 100-350m between northern Baja California and southern Alaska, with pelagic larvaes and juveniles occupying shallower habitats (30 - 150m) [@reynolds2001; bosley2014] closer to the coast [@quigley2024]. Individuals form dense feeding schools at night -- preying on euphausiids, copepods, salps, and small fishes -- and disperse at dawn [@reynolds2001; @bosley2014]. The eDNA concentration estimates for the rockfish are consistent with the shallower end of these expected habitats and previously reported trawl catches [@bosley2014], with the 50m samples capturing the majority of the signal (Fig. \ref{Fig4}) indicating mainly ichthoplankton presence. Similarly, the eDNA concentrations for northern lampfish (*Stenobrachius leucopsarus*) -- an abundant myctophid that migrates from 400-700m up to 20-200m at night [@moku2000; @suntsov2008] -- are again consistent with the ecology of the species, having notably lower concentrations in surface samples.

### **Benthic**

Among deeper-water fishes, eDNA revealed spatial and ontogenetic migration patterns for species that are common yet little studied, such as the dragonfish (*Tactostoma macropus*), which occurs roughly between 40°N-50°N (adults at 300-900m, larvae at 0-60m in summer) [@kawaguchi1993]. Juveniles transition to deeper waters as they mature, performing diel vertical migrations following krill to depths around 100 meters [@willis1982; @kawaguchi1993]. The eDNA concentrations appear to reflect this activity (Fig. \ref{Fig4}), with the predominant signal at northern latitudes likely reflecting larvae and juveniles (Fig. \ref{Fig1}), and two deeper concentration hotspots at 300m and 500m separated by about eight degrees of latitude. Also consistent with known habitats are commercially caught flatfish such as Dover sole (*Microstomus pacificus*), which lives at 200m to 1200m along the Pacific coast [@drazen2007; @brodziak2000; @drazen2012]; individuals move progressively deeper as they grow [@vetter1994; @hunter1990]. The eDNA concentration estimates are consistent with this pattern, showing high concentrations mostly in deep water samples (Fig. \ref{Fig4} A) and in shallower samples when located near the seabed (Fig. \ref{Fig1} A) revealing signals from all stages of their ontogenetic migration. 

## Species Associations



![Multispecies summaries\label{Fig2}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMARINeDNA/QM-qPCR-joint/refs/heads/main/plots/2.%20Figure_2.jpg)

Species sharing similar habitats have similar spatial distributions of eDNA  (Fig. \ref{Fig2}), particularly with respect to depth: surface, midwater, and deepwater species show overall distinct patterns of correlation. More subtle differentiation surface species, a subtle subdivision is also apparent, for example chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*) and sardine (*Sardinops sagax*) being more common in the more southern (and somewhat warmer) waters (Fig. \ref{Fig4}), while other epipelagic and mesopelagic species have higher eDNA concentrations in more northern waters. Concentrations of the remaining surface-dwelling species (northen anchovy, eulachon, jack mackerel, and pacific herring) are modestly correlated with midwater species (Figs.\ref{Fig2} and \ref{Fig4}) consistent with generally colder habitats -- for example,  and further suggesting that eDNA is capturing not only depth differences but also horizontal (latitudinal) habitats corresponding to species' temperature preferences. Deep-water species are distinct (Figs.\ref{Fig2} and \ref{Fig4}), not strongly correlated with those from other zones. Deeper water tends to feature lower and more diffuse fish eDNA concentrations [Fig. \ref{Fig4} and @shelton2022], such that any similiarities among species distributions are likely to be more difficult to detect.

## Species richness 

![Species richness\label{Fig4}](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMARINeDNA/QM-qPCR-joint/refs/heads/main/plots/3.%20Figure_3.jpg)

Species richness varied substantially and predictably by depth, with the highest richness observed at the surface (Fig. \ref{Fig3} A). In part, this pattern is likely to be an artifact of the focal species included in this study -- chosen for their relevance to fisheries management as well as for their abundance in the raw data -- but the richness-depth gradient also reflects the expectation that habitat and nutrient availability is greatest near the surface [@smith2002; @hickey2005]. Surface waters also host the eggs, larvae, and juvenile stages of meso- and bathypelagic species [@parnel2008], some of which we detect, and hence we both expect and observe higher richness in the upper layer of the water column [@kim2011]. 

Species richness also corresponds strongly with the influence of Columbia River plume (Fig. \ref{Fig3} A), which extends well beyond the coastline [@hickey2003]. The nitrate-rich river water interacts with ocean currents and intensifies coastal upwelling , enhancing both primary and secondary productivity [@hickey2010] and likely influencing the patterns of species richness we observe (Fig. \ref{Fig4} A) [@tolimieri2015]. The total fish eDNA accumulation (Fig. \ref{Fig3} B) suggests the highest aggregation of forage fish DNA near Heceta bank (44 degrees N; overlapping anchovy and sardine distributions are the two largest contributors to eDNA concentration) in addition to other commercialy important mesopelagic fish (*Sebastes entomelas* and *Tarletonbeania crenularis*) a center of abundance for commercial fisheries [@bosley2014; @Tissot2008TwentyYO], and elsewhere nearshore in areas of coastal upwelling.

# Discussion

We report patterns of species-specific eDNA concentrations that closely mirror the expected abundance distributions of the species themselves, in three dimensions and over ten degrees of latitude. Our results point to a broader use of eDNA for management of commercially important species, such as is required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act in the United States.

## eDNA as managment tool
<!--Basically this paragraph translates the results into perspective for eDNA applicability in management (either conservation, habitat suitability or biodiversity indices)-->
The eDNA surveys demonstrate significant potential as a tool for capturing species distributions and ecological dynamics, as evidenced by the depth, geography, and habitat preferences of the species analyzed in this study. Discrete depth sampling has the distinct advantage over other survey methods insofar as it can provide distribution estimates in three dimensions. Depth-stratified eDNA concentration for the species included here reflected species prefered habitats and to some extenct their physiological constraints (e.g., temperature tolerance or food availability). These patterns also capture diel vertical migrations, as observed in myctophids, where eDNA concentrations align with the species’ movement between surface and mid- to deepwater habitats. Furthermore, the detected latitudinal differences of eDNA concentration among species -- such as those between anchovy and sardine -- highlights species thermal ranges. When combined with prior ecological knowledge such surveys can aid identify areas of species high habitat suitability which are critical for conservation management. This is pivotal when studying cryptic, invasive, and hard-to-sample species with no prior knowledge, as their eDNA concentration and occurance can hint on their prefered habitats. Widow rockfish, for example, appear almost exclusively in the 50 m depth band, which is unsampled by traditional trawls. This species is of special interest because its commercial harvest has resumed after years of closure, and no existing survey adequately captures its patterns of abundance [CITE]. Additionally the ability of eDNA to detect different life stages of species is equally notable; for instance, larval aggregations (of surface and deepwater species) near the Columbia River align with known spawning grounds [CITE] and ontogenetic migration of dover sole, but distinguishing ichthyoplankton from adult signals requires further methodological refinement. This capability nonetheless demonstrates eDNA’s potential to encapsulate the ecosystem’s state holistically, particularly as it evolves into a more precise tool for ecological monitoring. Subsequently, our eDNA identified abundance aggregation and richness near high-productivity regions, signaling areas of conservation importance and highlighting hotspots of ecological and commercial value. For example, regions like Heceta bank host dense aggregations of forage fish, overlapping with areas of high primary productivity, and are critical not only for fishery management but also for the broader marine food web stability. While our focus has been on a subset of commercially and ecologically significant species, the method is equally applicable to any broader range of species. By detecting and mapping three dimentional spatial patterns, eDNA provides critical insights into species distributions, habitat preferences, and ecological processes, including diel and ontogenetic migrations, temperature ranges, and species richness. These findings underscore eDNA’s capacity to inform species distribution models, predict habitat suitability under environmental change [@liu2023], and support effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and sustainable fisheries management in dynamic marine ecosystems.


## Limitations of eDNA interpretations (we can find a better name for this)
<!--Basically this paragraphs is the limitation of our interpretations, i.e., factors that influence what we see through eDNA (transport, dilution, degradation, marine snow etc.)-->
These findings, consistent with established knowledge and literature [CITE], underline the promise of eDNA as a transformative tool for fisheries management, biodiversity conservation, and the study of environmental change. However, the observation and interpretation of eDNA signal is influenced by several physical, chemical, and biological factors, including transport, dilution, degradation, and environmental variability. As eDNA can be transported horizontally and vertically (through ocean currents and sinking organic material respectively) it can limit the spatial accuracy of its signals. For example the eDNA at depth reflects, to some degree, an attenuated signal from species nearer the surface [@shelton_2022]. 

This is likely a function of the overall abundance of species' eDNA and of the species' habitats: highly abundant surface species such as hake and anchovy show attenuated eDNA signals with depth, while less abundant species are more strictly associated with particular sampling depths (e.g., widow rockfish here) [SUPPLEMENT]. Abundant surface species' DNA is likely to be a component of marine snow, transported as feces and other waste materials via gravity to lower depths -- rarer species would accordingly make up a smaller fraction of genetic materal raining downward. Hake is more evenly distributed across depths. Additionally dilution and degradation plays a significant role in obtaining a meaningful signal from eDNA and its source The observable eDNA signal is an integrated function of production and loss terms (blurred somewhat by sampling variability, which we address elsewhere; Gold et al. 2023). Qualitatively, if we imagine the rate of eDNA loss (via degradation or sinking) as being fast relative to transport (via surface currents and, to a limited extent, diffusion), an eDNA signal will be detectable only close to a source animal in space and time. The scale over which the eDNA signal is observable will be a function of the ratio of production and loss terms in any given context. We refer to this spatial scale as environmental smoothing of eDNA signal relative to the source animals themselves.

Large-scale sampling combined with spatial smoothing mitigates many challenges associated with eDNA transport and degradation, allowing reliable detection of broad patterns in species distributions. For example, while hake show relatively even eDNA distribution across latitude and depths, rarer species are sporadically detected, producing less granular spatial maps. For these low-abundance species, species occupancy models may yield more accurate results than smoothing techniques by accounting for their limited detectability. The correspondence between fish distributions and their expected habitat suitability further supports the robustness of eDNA, as degradation effects appear consistent across species within large-scale surveys. However, species reliant on colder habitats may experience more detectable biases if degradation rates differ significantly under varying temperature regimes. These patterns suggest that while eDNA provides a reliable reflection of species distributions, it is influenced by species abundance and ecological characteristics, requiring careful interpretation. These insights highlight the importance of considering both abiotic and biotic factors in eDNA surveys, ensuring that transport, degradation, and species-specific dynamics are accounted for in models and analyses. By addressing these nuances, eDNA offers a robust framework for assessing biodiversity and ecological processes, even in complex and dynamic marine environments.

## Environmental Smoothing and Sampling Frequency

In general, the scale of environmental sampling limits the resolution with which we can understand spatial variability in a signal. Characterizing a strong, continuous signal -- here, a high concentration of a species' DNA persisting in the environment -- requires fewer sampling points in space than does a more subtle or discrete signal. We therefore expect schooling, high-biomass fish species with broad distributions (sardine, anchovy) to have strong eDNA signals that vary smoothly over space given our sampling design, while more solitary species should be detected more sporadically. Our observations are consistent with these expectations.

Although eDNA may remain detectable kilometers away from a source (under unidirectional flow; Pont et al; Thalinger et al), it is by far most abundant within meters of the source (Xiong et al. in review). Moreover, the vast majority of eDNA an animal sheds into the environment is lost from surface samples within a period of hours (Brasseale et al in review). The horizontal scale of environmental smoothing in the present dataset is therefore kilometers at most. Because sampling stations are spaced at intervals greater than 30 km, the spatial patterns we report are likely to reflect real differences in abundance rather than artifacts arising from transport [@guri2023].

Vertical smoothing, by contrast, appears minimal -- perhaps at the scale of meters: shallow-water species (sardine, anchovy, herring) occur largely at the surface and 50m depth bins, *Sebastes entomelas* occurs almost exclusively at the 50m depth bin (its known habitat; CITE), species found throughout the water column are either diel vertical migrators or species occupying different depths at various life-history stages (Fig. \ref{Fig1}), and bottom-dwelling fishes are detected primarily at the deepest point sampled on any station.

## Maximizing Information from Existing Surveys

Although we have shown an example of the substantial value of multispecies eDNA analysis for fisheries and other natural-resource management questions, eDNA data alone do not provide information on size- or age structure of the kind important to traditional fisheries management. Moreover, the eDNA sampling itself depends upon fisheries research vessel cruises for access to deep water. Finally fisheries control-rules are expressed in units of mass; converting from DNA concentration to species mass requires data external to the eDNA signal.

Effective management of natural resources at a continental scale requires that we maximize the information content of existing sampling regimes. Here, we follow Shelton et al. (2023) and Liu et al. (in prep?), leveraging the same water samples to provide information on an additional 13 species of commercial importance. Elsewhere, the same set of samples has yielded information on the distribution of marine mammals (Valdivia et al, in revision). We therefore see eDNA as an important datastream that maximizes the information value of existing research cruises, rather than a means of replacing those cruises themselves.

## Observation Model

Unlike single-species observation methods, metabarcoding data yields information on species proportions rather than absolute values. Metabarcoding has no generalizable species-specific detection probability (= sensitivity) because the probability of detection for a given species depends strongly upon an interaction between the other species in the reaction and on the total read-depth for the sample. Where total read-depth is greater, rarer species are more likely to be detected, conditional on their having been sampled and on their amplifiability with the PCR primer being used.

The observation model we use here focuses on species common in the raw dataset, which are those farthest from the lower limits of detection within the present context, and therefore having the highest confidence for consistent detectability.

Our observation model also depends upon detection of hake (our reference species) in both metabarcoding and qPCR datasets for each water sample (\~ 95% ?? of all samples); samples omitted from analysis for lack of hake detections were sporadically distributed in the data, and their omission appears not to have induced substantial bias in our estimates (SUPPLEMENT).

The raw dataset (SUPPLEMENT) contained many more species than we chose to analyze here, nearly all of which were rarer in the data.



## Future developments

Having prior information about the species and using eDNA in conjuction with previous knowledge of the species can reveal crutialinformation (i.e., life stages, temp tolerance etc.) but this is not always the case as sometimes you would want the eDNA to give information for species that you don't have information.

Food web connectivity through different markers. For example indicating if DNA signal is from Ichthyoplanktons or adults one can see if their prey or predator eDNA signal is high.

# Methods

## Sample Collection, Processing, and Quantitative PCR (qPCR)

Samples were collected in 2.5L Niskin bottles at five depths from stations along the West Coast of the US aboard the ship *Bell Shimada* during Summer 2019, filtered immediately on 47 mm diameter mixed cellulose-ester sterile filters with a 1 $\mu$m pore size, subsequently extracted using a phase-lock phenol-chloroform protocol, and analysed in triplicate using a qPCR assay as described in @ramon-laca2021 and @shelton2022. 

## Metabarcoding: Environmental Samples and Mock Community

In total, 347 environmental samples were randomized and divided into 7 sequencing libraries for an Illumina MiSeq (v3 600 cycle kit). Total PCR reactions included eDNA samples (n = xxx), PCR blanks (n = xxx), positive controls (n = 8), extraction blanks (n = xxx), fieldwork water and air blank (n = xxx and xxx respectively), were amplified using MiFish-U universal primers [bolded; @miya2015a] with Illumina tails (forward TCG TCG GCA GCG TCA GAT GTG TAT AAG AGA CAG **GCC GGT AAA ACT CGT GCC AGC**; reverse GTC TCG TGG GCT CGG AGA TGT GTA TAA GAG ACAG **CA TAG TGG GGT ATC TAA TCC CAG TTTG**). DNA was amplified in the first PCR reaction (PCR1) in a 20 $\mu$L reaction consisting of: 10 $\mu$L of Phusion Master Mix (2X), 0.4 $\mu$L of the forward primer (10 $\mu$M); 0.4 $\mu$L of the reverse primer (10 $\mu$M), 0.6 $\mu$L of 100% DMSO, 0.5 $\mu$L of recombinant albumin (20 $\mu$g/$\mu$L), 4.4 $\mu$L of nuclease-free water and 2 $\mu$L of DNA template. Reactions were run with the following cycling conditions: 98°C for 30s; 35 cycles of 98°C for 10s, 60°C for 30s, and of 72°C for 3s; 72°C for 10m.

PCR product was cleaned using Ampure Beads (1.2x) and then indexed in a second reaction (12.5 $\mu$L KAPA Hifi HotStart ReadyMix, 1.25 $\mu$L of nucleotide indexes (one per sample, Illumina Corp., IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA UD Index), 5 ul of PCR1 product and 6.25 of nuclease-free water) with cycling conditions of 95°C for 5m; 8 cycles of 98°C for 20s, 56°C for 30s, 72°C for 1m; 72°C for 5m. Products were visualized on a 2% agarose gel and quantified using Quant-iT™ dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with Fluoroskan™ Microplate Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Indexed products were pooled into libraries for sequencing, and then size- selected to extract only the target fish band using the E-Gel™ SizeSelect™ II Agarose Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

Sequences were de-multiplexed and the adapters removed by Illumina sequencing. Primers were removed with Cutadapt v4.9 [@martin2011]. We then used DADA2 [default parameters, @callahan2016] to denoise sequences, remove chimeras, and generate amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). The sequences were then blasted against the NCBI nucleotide (nt) database (access: August 2024) using BLASTn algorithm with a cut off at 97% identity, assigning the least common ancestor of the top hit, resulting in species, genus, family, or higher rank classifications. Samples with fewer total number of reads than 1000 were removed from downstream analysis as indicator of poor reliability. Bioinformatic pipeline code and relevant data are available [HERE xxx].

To calibrate metabarcoding observations and account for amplification bias [@gold2023; @shelton2023], we generated multiple mock communities comprising a total of 39 fish species. Vouchered DNA extracts or tissues were obtained from either the University of Washington Fish Collection at the Burke Museum or the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center collections. After quantifying the concentration of mitochondrial DNA template in each DNA extract, we constructed a total of eight mock communities (4 even and 4 skewed proportions of mitochondrial DNA) of varying species compositions (see SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS xxx). We selected 13 species of commercial and ecological importance that co-occurred in the environmental samples and in the mock community for downstream analysis: Pacific herring (*Clupea pallasii*), northern anchovy (*Engraulis mordax*), northern smoothtongue (*Leuroglossus stilbius*), Dover sole (*Microstomus pacificus*), Pacific sardine (*Sardinops sagax*), Pacific chub mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*), widow rockfish (*Sebastes entomelas*), northern lampfish (*Stenobrachius leucopsarus*), California barracudina (Tactostoma macropus), plainfin midshipman (*Tarletonbeania crenularis*), eulachon (*Thaleichthys pacificus*), Pacific jack mackerel (*Trachurus symmetricus*), and Pacific hake (*Merluccius productus*). After amplification and sequencing using the protocols outlined above, we used the mock communities to estimate species-specific amplification efficiencies and correct for amplification bias following @shelton2022.


## Statistical analysis

Having estimated the initial proportions of each species in environmental samples, we then used the absolute quantity of Pacific hake (from qPCR) to expand, for each sample, the proportions into absolute eDNA estimates (copies/$\mu$L) for each species as described in @guri2024a and @allan2023 in a joint model implemented Stan [@standevelopmentteam2023] (see Supplementary math & code). 

Finally, we smoothed the species-specific DNA concentrations ($C$) at each depth sampled (d = 0, 50, 150, 300 or 500 m) using sdmTMB package [@anderson2022] to generate distribution models for the concentration of eDNA , as:
$$
ln(C_{xyz})=\alpha_d + \omega(s)+\epsilon_d(s)
$$
where $x,y,z$ index longitude, latitude, and depth (respectively), $\alpha_d$ is the spatial intercept for each depth, $\omega(s)$ is the smooth spline as a function of sample depth (in m), and $\epsilon_d(s)$ is a smooth, depth-dependent error term. 

Each species was fitted individually while we created and selected the best mesh for approximating spatial Gaussian random fields as part of the model. [OWEN add detail]

All statistical analysis, figure preparation, and data curation were performed in R [@rcoreteam2024].
