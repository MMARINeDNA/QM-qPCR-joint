Error:  Exception: normal_lpdf: Location parameter is inf, but must be finite! (in 'string', line 190, column 8 to column 73)
Note: this is in the part of the model that samples the y[i] as a normal(Ct,sigma)
Specifically, it had an issue with the sigma (i.e. location) param
Investigating this further in the transformed params block, sigma is a function of the gamma params and the Concentration vector
Gamma params have priors and so they shouldn't be the issue; once again the issue is in "filling" the Concentration vector
Putting a print statement for the Concentration vector,we get -inf values in some of the STANDARDS, NOT the unknowns
Identified the problem: there was a double log going on; i.e., the copy numbers in the standards were being logged before they
went into the model, and then AGAIN in the transformed data block. Because some of the original copy numbers were 1, this messed 
everything up (because log(1)=0 and log(0)= -Inf)


08.19.2024 Checking divergences
Model is sampling, but almost all divergent transitions--why??
Ole and Owen went through using print statements etc.
Added a few initial values to help (for beta_std_curve_0 and beta_std_curve_1)
Still having an issue: Ct values are not changing across samples-- why??
Ole and Owen going to dig into indexing issues

09.13.2024 New updates
Major updates to the model, converging now
Now, trying to optimize the sampling

TODO:
Tried centering log_D_raw and tightening the prior
Removing the hard lower bound on beta_std_curve_1.
Adding eta_mock back into the metabarcoding
Check paired bio replicates
Added eta_mock back in, and made it N(0,tau) with tau ~ gamma(100,1000)
Check the few outliers in the qPCR
Check stepsize after the warmup is complete
Compare qPCR samples that match MB vs. non-matched samples and compare overdispersion
