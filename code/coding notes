Error:  Exception: normal_lpdf: Location parameter is inf, but must be finite! (in 'string', line 190, column 8 to column 73)
Note: this is in the part of the model that samples the y[i] as a normal(Ct,sigma)
Specifically, it had an issue with the sigma (i.e. location) param
Investigating this further in the transformed params block, sigma is a function of the gamma params and the Concentration vector
Gamma params have priors and so they shouldn't be the issue; once again the issue is in "filling" the Concentration vector
Putting a print statement for the Concentration vector,we get -inf values in some of the STANDARDS, NOT the unknowns
Identified the problem: there was a double log going on; i.e., the copy numbers in the standards were being logged before they
went into the model, and then AGAIN in the transformed data block. Because some of the original copy numbers were 1, this messed 
everything up (because log(1)=0 and log(0)= -Inf)


08.19.2024 Checking divergences
Model is sampling, but almost all divergent transitions--why??
Ole and Owen went through using print statements etc.
Added a few initial values to help (for beta_std_curve_0 and beta_std_curve_1)
Still having an issue: Ct values are not changing across samples-- why??
Ole and Owen going to dig into indexing issues

09.13.2024 New updates
Major updates to the model, converging now
Now, trying to optimize the sampling
Tried centering log_D_raw and tightening the prior
Removing the hard lower bound on beta_std_curve_1.
Adding eta_mock back into the metabarcoding
Check paired bio replicates
Added eta_mock back in, and made it N(0,tau) with tau ~ gamma(100,1000)

09.19.2024 New updates
Have added some output plotting and spatial smoothing, but still issues with eta and alphas (variability in the mocks)
Trying to swap to the Dirichlet multinomial to account for overdispersion, and removing eta for now
To do this, edited the code in qm_qpcr_joint-DM. Now there are two versions of the Stan model (Dirichlet vs. multinomial)
Removed model_matrix_samp and other declared data and params that weren't being used anymore in our parameterization

09.25.24
Managed to get a decent fit if dm_alpha0 is fixed (~1000) and applied to both mocks and samples
Also removed many MB field samples that had only hake and nothing else in them, because we suspect it was messing with fitting
This results in reasonable estimates that are in the ballpark of what we expect

09.26.24
Ole has been working on a set of model runs with FIXED alphas (from a separate mocks-only model) and no mocks
One version includes the reduced set of MB samples (the ones with only hake), and one includes the original set of samples
Both converged, and provide quantitatively similar predictions of log_D
BUT, the alphas are different

Trying a version with LIKELIHOOD WEIGHTING on the mocks, and adding a separate mean and variance for each species' log_D,
but no fixed alphas and regular multinomial for field samples
Seemed to work okay with a fixed dm_alpha0
Trying with dm_alpha0 as a param
